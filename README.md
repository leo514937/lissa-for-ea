# LiSSA: A Framework for Generic Traceability Link Recovery

<img src=".github/images/approach.svg" alt="Approach Overview" style="width: 100%;" /><br/>

Welcome to the LiSSA project!
This framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to establish traceability links across various software artifacts.

## Overview

In software development and maintenance, numerous artifacts such as requirements, code, and architecture documentation are produced.
Understanding the relationships between these artifacts is crucial for tasks like impact analysis, consistency checking, and maintenance.
LiSSA aims to provide a generic solution for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) by utilizing LLMs in combination with RAG techniques.

The concept and evaluation of LiSSA are detailed in our paper:

> Fuchß, D., Hey, T., Keim, J., Liu, H., Ewald, N., Thirolf, T., & Koziolek, A. (2025). LiSSA: Toward Generic Traceability Link Recovery through Retrieval-Augmented Generation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering, Ottawa, Canada.

## Features

- **Generic Applicability**: LiSSA is designed to recover traceability links across various types of software artifacts, including:
  - [Requirements to code](https://ardoco.de/c/icse25)
  - [Documentation to code](https://ardoco.de/c/icse25)
  - [Architecture documentation to architecture models](https://ardoco.de/c/icse25)
  - [Requirements to requirements](https://ardoco.de/c/refsq25)
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: By combining LLMs with RAG, LiSSA enhances the accuracy and relevance of the recovered traceability links.

## Documentation

The documentation is organized into several sections:

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): Detailed information about the project's architecture and components
- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md): Guide for configuring LiSSA
- [CLI Usage](docs/cli.md): Information about using the command line interface
- [Caching](docs/caching.md): Information about the caching system and Redis setup
- [Development](docs/development.md): Development setup and contribution guidelines

## Getting Started

To get started with LiSSA, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ardoco/lissa
   cd lissa
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Java JDK 21 or later installed. Then, build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. **Run LiSSA**:
   Execute the main application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/lissa-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar eval -c config.json
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a configuration you want to use for evaluation / execution. E.g., you can find configurations [here](https://github.com/ArDoCo/ReplicationPackage-ICSE25_LiSSA-Toward-Generic-Traceability-Link-Recovery-through-RAG/tree/main/LiSSA-RATLR-V2/lissa/configs/req2code-significance). You can also provide a directory containing multiple configurations.
2. Configure your API keys for the language model platforms you plan to use as environment variables. See the [configuration documentation](docs/configuration.md#supported-platforms-and-environment-variables) for details on supported platforms (OpenAI, Open WebUI, Ollama, Blablador, DeepSeek) and their required environment variables.
3. LiSSA caches requests in order to be reproducible. The cache is located in the cache folder that can be specified in the configuration.
4. Run `java -jar target/lissa-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar eval -c configs/....` to run the evaluation. You can provide a JSON or a directory containing JSON configurations.
5. The results will be printed to the console and saved to a file in the current directory. The name is also printed to the console.

### Results of Evaluation / Execution

The results will be stored as markdown files.
A result file can look like below.
It contains the configuration and the results of the evaluation.
Additionally, the LiSSA generate CSV files that contain the traceability links as pairs of identifiers.

```json
## Configuration
{
  "cache_dir" : "./cache-r2c/dronology-dd--102959883",
  "gold_standard_configuration" : {
    "hasHeader" : false,
    "path" : "./datasets/req2code/dronology-dd/answer.csv"
  },
  "... other configuration parameters ..."
}

## Evaluation

LiSSA has been empirically evaluated on four different TLR tasks:

- Requirements to code
- Documentation to code
- Architecture documentation to architecture models
- Requirements to requirements

The results indicate that the RAG-based approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in code-related tasks.
However, further research is needed to enhance its performance for broader applicability.
